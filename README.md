# Event Sphere



Answer:


-1.A: {}
-Descriptin: The output will be an empty object {}. We are declared a variable called "greeting" but then assigned an empty object to a variable called "greetign" (with a typo). 


-2.C: "12"
-Descriptin: We are trying to add num with string. The result will be the string concatenation of "1" and "2", which is "12".


-3.A: ['üçï', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî']
-Descriptin: This "info" property update does not affect the food array in any way. The food array and the info object are separate entities in memory, and changing the value of info.favoriteFood does not change the contents of the food array. The food array will remain the same.


-4. B: Hi there, undefined
-Descriptin: We are defined a function called sayHi that takes one parameter name and returns a greeting string. However, when you call sayHi() without providing an argument, it will result in an error because the function expects an argument name, and you haven't provided one.


-5. C: 3
-Discription:  We have an array called nums containing numbers from 0 to 3, and you want to count how many of those numbers are truthy. You use the forEach method to iterate over the elements of the nums array and increment the count variable. There are three truthy elements in the nums array (1, 2, and 3), the count variable will be incremented three times. Therefore, when you log count to the console, it will output is 3.
